	This site shows the flow of funds from one address to another.
	<br>
	So far only USDT on ETH and USDT on Polygon are supported.
	<br>
	Let me know if you want to see other coins / chains. 	
	<br>
	<br>
	To address (Example: your address) 
	<br>
	<input type="text" id="fromAddress" size="50">
	<br>
 
	From address (Example: casino address) 
	<br>
	<input type="text" id="toAddress" size="50">
	<!--<div id="hiddenMessage" style="display:block"> -->
	<p>If you put multiple addresses in a field separated by spaces or commas this should work too.
	<br>
	If instead of address you put a whole number X (Ex: 10) in "From address" field, you will get graphs of "To address" against its top X contacts(i.e. the ones he sent the most or got the most from ) and also the graph of him vs everybody else.</p>
	The number of days to check for transactions (Examples: 10 -> last 10 days, 0.25 -> last 6 hours)
	</p>
	<br>
	<input type="text" id="daysToCheck" placeholder="7" value="7">
	<br>
	The maximum number of dates on the graph. (If there are too many points on graphs your browser can run out of memory.)
	<br>
	<input type="text" id="maxPoints" placeholder="1000" value="1000">
